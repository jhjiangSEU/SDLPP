# SDLPP
## How to start?
Just run demo.m.


## Data sets
Because the data sets are too large, we only provide a synthetic data set slashdot with r=1,2,3 and a real-world data set lost.
- Real-world data sets are publicly available at: http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/Resources.htm#data.
- Synthetic data sets are derived from multi-label benchmark data sets by retaining examples with only one relevant label.
   Specically, given a multi-class example (x_i, y_i), its corresponding partial label training example (xi, W_i) is generated by 
   randomly adding r class labels from Y into Si. You can get these multi-label data sets at: http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html,
   http://waikato.github.io/meka/datasets/, and https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/.
